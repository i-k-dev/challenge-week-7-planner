# Week 07 Challenge: Third-Party APIs: Daily Planner App

This Challenge will require me to leverage all the skills I've learned so far, requiring myself to think about DOM manipulation, advanced JavaScript, integration of third-party APIs, and more. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and Moment.js.
